**ShareCoords** is a **datapack** that **allows** you to **send** your **coordinates** in **chat!** (with additional **features**)

---

## Commands

`/trigger ShareCoords` lets you send your coordinates and the dimension in which you are in chat.
> others will see the distance between you if they are in the same dimension.

`/trigger Switch_SC` enables or disables particles leading to the person who shared their coordinates.
> enabled by default, only works if the sharer is in the same dimension.

## Chat example

> The Switch_SC trigger particles won't work in non-vanilla dimensions.

The particles from the Switch_SC trigger will lead towards the last person that shared their coordinates.
> The particles lasts for **20 seconds**, can be changed in the tick.mcfunction under the **Adjust** comment.
